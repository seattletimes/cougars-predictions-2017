And if they can pull off an upset or two, it could be an elite one. They have an elite quarterback in Luke Falk, a deep and talented running corps, and a solid offensive line. As usual with the Cougars, it will come down to defense, and with nine starters back, that looks promising, too.",

The key for them will be avoiding any pitfalls in the non-conference schedule, which they haven't been able to do over the past couple of seasons. That convincing win over Stanford last year proved how potent WSU's offense could be. Unfortunately, in games that mattered most (Colorado, Washington, Minnesota in the Holiday Bowl) the Cougs didn't show up. We'll see if that can change this season. ",

But the losses late last season to Colorado and UW showed that WSU also still has some work to do build up the all-around roster to get to the point of truly contending. ",

Leach has never started 4-1, much less 5-0, in his Pullman tenure. His best start is 3-2. This year, with all five at home, 3-2 won’t cut it.",

With a veteran squad led by senior Luke Falk and All-American left tackle Cody O'Connell, WSU will be in the conversation for the Pac-12 North title all season. But, can they win the big ones this season?",
